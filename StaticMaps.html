<a href = "https://sharitau.github.io/Portfolio/assets/TourDeEastCoast.pdf"> <img src="assets/Tour.JPG" alt="U.S. East Coast bike trail" width="350" height="300" border = "0" align = "right"> </a> <p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp; This map challenged me to work with both
raster and vector data at the same time while also learning how to represent topographic data. To do this, I made a roughly 21000-mile bike tour similar to the Tour De France.   </p>

<p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp;This map was very challenging and I learning taught me the importance of carefully picking landsat data. My intial version of this map was very
  pixelated due to bad landsat area and I ended up having to chose new landsat data and starting almost from scratch. While this version is much better and I really enjoy that some of the labels were duplicated to create shadows
  of themselves so that they stand out, in retrospect I didn't think I choose the best colors for this map, everything is a bit visually loud for me.

<a href = "https://sharitau.github.io/Portfolio/assets/Fertility_Rates.pdf"> <img src="assets/Fertility_Rates.JPG" alt="Fertility Rate Infographic" width="350" height="300" border = "0" align = "left"> </a> <p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp; This infographic showcases my Adobe Illustrator
skills by telling an engaging story about the decline of fertility rates while featuring a bivariate map and a graph. </p>

<p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp;This infographic took quite a bit of time as I had to play with graphics, colors, and fonts a lot. I even tried to tell the story in an even more
  brief way by highlight all of the most imporant text in red. Overall I think it's really good. If I had to change something however, I think I could have worked a bit more on eliminating blank space and using more graphics in place of words.

<a href = "https://sharitau.github.io/Portfolio/assets/Atlanta-Film.pdf"> <img src="assets/Atlanta-Films.JPG" alt="Atlanta Film Map" width="350" height="300" border = "0" align = "right"> </a> <p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp; The goal of this map was to
simply explore an aspect of cartographic representation that demonstrates my personal interest. As someone who lives in the Atlanta metropolitan area who enjoys movies, I explored that various
places Atlanta has been dressed up to portray due to the wide variety of neighborhoods with different architectural themes. </p>

<p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp;This has been one of my most fun maps to make since I enjoyed the background information of researching the various movies that have been filmed
  in the area and the setting of those movies. I also enjoyed learning how to make the spotlight for each neighborhood. The one thing I would change however are the colors of map. I should have
  used reds, whites, and blacks to represent Hollywood and the red carpet.

<a href = "https://sharitau.github.io/Portfolio/assets/NASAChoropleth.pdf"> <img src="assets/NASA.JPG" alt="NASA Choropleth Map" width="350" height="300" border = "0" align = "left"> </a> <p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp; In my map of NASA funding, I attempted to tell
the story of minorities in regards to NASA funding per state. I ended up being able to show that most states with a high amount of   </p>

<p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp;This map was a bit hard to make and while the story is told, I think these weren't two great variables to use
  for this map and that it's pretty easy to lose the story. So while the process of making the map itself was very sucessful, I think I could have chose a better topic
  which would have made this map more meaningful.

<br><br><br><br>

<a href = "https://sharitau.github.io/Portfolio/assets/Africa.pdf"> <img src="assets/africa.JPG" alt="Africa Reference Map" width="350" height="300" border = "0" align = "right"> </a> <p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp; My map of Africa was to be used for a fictional monograph
   as a reference map to serve as a spatial catalog for the places and regions. Hence, it needed to be dense and act as a one-stop graphic of the political geography. </p>

<p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp;I enjoy this map quite a bit and think it's pretty good, however I shold have zoomed
  out more to myself room to label the west African nations and adjusted the placement of coastal cities' labels so that they are entirely in
  the water.

<a href = "https://sharitau.github.io/Portfolio/assets/Pennsylvania.pdf"> <img src="assets/Pennsylvania.JPG" alt="Penssylvania Brochure Map" width="350" height="300" border = "0" align = "left"> </a> <p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp; This was one of the first maps I made. The goal of it was to make a protoype for a brochure featuring each state in the United States. It needed to feature an inset map, emphaize cultural, historal, environmental, or recreational points,
and feature call outs.</p>

<p style = "color: #454561; font-size:25px">&emsp;&ensp;While the goal of my map was met and I think it's  a pretty good visualization and featues good color selections,
  if I had to do it again, I would make the shadows for my callouts neater so that they fit behind the callouts better, as well as I would move some of my labels so that
  they aren't on the state boundary line.
